# Intro-to-AI---Chatbot-maker

This assignment assesses the following module learning outcomes:
      “Design and implement intelligent solutions using at least two different architectures”. 
In this assignment I designed and implemented a chatbot using an expert system architecture.  
Working on this assignment, it helped me to gain experience of creating intelligent solutions 
that embed user knowledge in a human-readable rule-based form. 

A set of 50 questions, and their required responses are provided in a text file.
The task is to design and implement the knowledge base for an AIML-based chatbot that is able 
to correctly answer all of the questions provided.   

•	Note that the required responses must be matched exactly.
•	A copy of the programme that does the automated marking will also be provided in the coursework folder, 
along with instructions for using it should you prefer to develop and/or test your system on your own machine.
